### Custom PCB

This is an Arduino Shield designed to be specifically used with the MIDI stepper synth. In this design, the MIDI interface is built-in, so it is all in one!

Note that when you are uploading code, be sure to remove the shield from the arduino!

Source files were made in KiCad 5.1.9 and this includes the Gerber files and BOM so that you can build it yourself. All components can be sourced from Digikey and Amazon.
